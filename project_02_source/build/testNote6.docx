- The project is done in groups: each group has a maximum of 3 students
- The same exercises will all be scored 0 for the entire practice (even though there are
scores for other exercises and practice projects).
- Operating System: Linux
2. Submission:
Submit assignments directly on the course website (MOODLE), not accepting
submissions via email or other forms.
Filename: StudentID1_StudentID2_StudentID3.zip (with StudentID1 < StudentID2<
StudentID3)
Ex: Your group has 2 students: 2312001, 2312002 and 2312003, the filename is:
2312001_2312002_2312003.zip
Include:
● StudentID1_StudentID2_StudentID3_Report.pdf: Writeups should be short and
sweet. Do not spend too much effort or include your source code on your writeups.
The purpose of the report is to give you an opportunity to clarify your solution, any
problems with your work, and to add information that may be useful in grading. If
you had specific problems or issues, approaches you tried that didn’t work, or
concepts that were not fully implemented, then an explanation in your report may
help us to assign partial credit
● Release: File diff (diff patch, Ex: $ git diff > StudentID1_StudentID2_StudentID3.patch)
● Source: Zip file of xv6 (the version is made clean)
3. Demo Interviews
Your implementation is graded on completeness, correctness, programming style, thoroughness
of testing, your solution, and code understanding.
When administering this course, we do our best to give a fair assessment to each individual
based on each person's contribution to the project
4. Requirements
In the last lab you used system calls to write a few utilities. In this lab you will add some new
system calls to xv6, which will help you understand how they work and will expose you to some
of the internals of the xv6 kernel. You will add more system calls in later labs.
Before you start coding, read Chapter 2 of the xv6 book, and Sections 4.3 and 4.4 of Chapter 4,
and related source files:
● The user-space "stubs" that route system calls into the kernel are in user/usys.S, which
is generated by user/usys.pl when you run make. Declarations are in user/user.h
● The kernel-space code that routes a system call to the kernel function that implements it
is in kernel/syscall.c and kernel/syscall.h.
● Process-related code is kernel/proc.h and kernel/proc.c.
To start the lab, switch to the syscall branch
